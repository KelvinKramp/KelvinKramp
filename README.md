Iâ€™m a medical doctor and researcher with a PhD in surgical education. I currently work as a freelancer in different fields of medicine and also at health-tech company Ada Health. I believe that whether you are a medical doctor, nurse, physio-therapist or someone else who is involved in health-care, learning automatisation, data science and machine learning can increase your work efficiency and efficacy and by doing so ultimately will improve your life and those of others. 

Learning these skills will involve learning how to read and write code. This can be a complex task at times. However, the establishment and continual development of the open source community shows us that people are happy to help others, that people are good at heart, and that if we join our efforts nothing is impossible. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  1) List of imporvements for the android artificial pancreas app [androidAPS](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS). 
  2) A consultation scheduler android app with a connection to a SQL database (I have created a [working frontend](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/ConsultationSchedulingApp) in Python with Dash that I used with permission from my supervisor during medical drivers license checks) 
  3) Green trading app. If you also believe that capitalism can be used for the better and are willing to work on this project send my a pm. 
  4) Im increasing my knowledge on blockchain technology and crypto (Solidity coding, reading the white papers, investing and thinking about how the new form of money can change the world.)   
  5) Teaching myself how to do pull requests and get 
- On my to do list are:

  3) A partner dance event quality watchdog website.
