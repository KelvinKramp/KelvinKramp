Iâ€™m a medical doctor and researcher with a PhD in surgical education. I currently work as a freelancer in different fields of medicine and also at health-tech company Ada Health. I believe that whether you are a medical doctor, nurse, physio-therapist or someone else who is involved in health-care, learning automatisation, data science and machine learning can increase your work efficiency and efficacy and by doing so ultimately will improve your life and those of others. 

Learning these skills will involve learning how to read and write code. This can be a complex task at times. However, the establishment and continual development of the open source community shows us that people are happy to help others, that people are good at heart, and that if we join our efforts nothing is impossible. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  1) Improvements the android artificial pancreas app (androidAPS). 
  2) A consultation hour schdule android app with a connection to an SQL database (already created a working frontend in Python with Dash, see https://github.com/KelvinKramp/ConsultationSchedulingApp) 
  3) A partner dance dance school scheduler app.
  4) Green trader. If you also believe that capitalism can be used for the better
  5) Im increasing my knowledge on blockchain technology and crypto (Solidity coding, reading the white papers, investing and thinking about how the new form of money can change the world.)   
- On my to do list are: 
  1) An app to schedule and organize partner dance classes (with a focus on self organizing equal balances in leaders/followers),
  2) A Heroku feedback form to obtain feedback on my latest book. 
  3) A partner dance event quality watchdog website.
