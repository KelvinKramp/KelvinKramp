I believe that whether you are a medical doctor, nurse, physio-therapist or someone else who is involved in health-care, learning automation, data science and machine learning can increase your work efficiency and efficacy and by doing so ultimately will improve your life and those of others. 

Learning these skills will involve learning how to read and write code. This can be a complex task at times. However, the establishment and continual development of the open source community shows us that people are happy to help others, that people are good at heart, and that if we join our efforts nothing is impossible. 

- üõ†Ô∏è I‚Äôm currently working on:
  1) List of improvements for the android artificial pancreas app [androidAPS](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS): a) alarm reduction :heavy_check_mark:, b) double wave bolusses, c) feedback to the loop from body activity retrieved from sportwatch, d) email alert when cgm/infusion replacement is needed, e) I also wonder whether machine learning analysis of boluses, basals, activity, intake and sleep pattern can be used to reduce fluctuations within the loop.  
  2) Im increasing my knowledge on blockchain technology and crypto (solidity coding, re-re-reading the white papers, investing and thinking about how the new form of money can change the world.)   
  3) Teaching myself how to do pull requests and learning how to contribute to the projects of others. 

- üìï On my to do list are: 
  1) An app to schedule and organize partner dance classes (with a focus on self organizing equal balances in leaders/followers).
  2) Medical doctors feedback app ("MediFeed" or something??..), an browser and smartphone app that you can use to grade the consultation experience end give feedback for improvement.

- Recent completed projects:
  1) [Feedback website](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/BookFeedback) for my recently written self-published book on Amazon [Urban kiz: a new vision on partner dance](https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Kiz-vision-partner-dance/dp/9090344306). 
  2) [Interactive agenda](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/ConsultationSchedulingApp) for medical drivers license checks. (Also used with permission from managers from the company). 
  3) [Voice assisted drug prescription](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/voice-assisted-drug-prescription)
  4) [Organisation ethnicity diversity checker](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/ethnicity-detector)
  5) [Vital signs tracking dashboard](https://github.com/KelvinKramp/vital-signs-Dash-python)
